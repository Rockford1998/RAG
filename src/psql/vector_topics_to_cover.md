### üìò **Foundations to Cover**

1. **What is a Vector Database?**

   * Difference between traditional DBs and vector DBs
   * Use cases: semantic search, recommendation systems, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

2. **Embeddings and Vectors**

   * What are embeddings?
   * How textual, visual, or audio data is converted to vectors
   * Cosine similarity vs Euclidean distance

3. **Indexing Techniques**

   * Flat vs approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)
   * Algorithms: HNSW, IVF, PQ, ScaNN, Faiss

4. **Vector DB Internals**

   * Storage: how vectors are stored and indexed
   * Filtering (metadata), hybrid search
   * Scalability: sharding, replication, streaming inserts

### üõ†Ô∏è **Popular Vector Databases**

We'll deep dive into their architecture and APIs:

* **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) ‚Äì good for local, performant search
* **Pinecone** ‚Äì fully managed cloud vector DB
* **Weaviate** ‚Äì hybrid search, modular
* **Milvus** ‚Äì open-source, high-performance, scalable
* **Qdrant** ‚Äì open-source with filtering and clustering
* **pgvector** ‚Äì PostgreSQL extension, great for integrating vector search into relational DBs

### üí° **Advanced Topics**

* Vector compression techniques
* Index maintenance & update strategies
* Vector search in production (monitoring, latency, costs)
* RAG + Vector DB integration (LangChain, LlamaIndex)

### ‚úÖ Learning Plan Suggestion

Would you like a structured roadmap like:

1. Week-by-week topics
2. Hands-on project ideas (e.g., build a semantic search engine)
3. Tool-specific tutorials (e.g., using pgvector or Milvus with LangChain)

Let me know your preferences, and I‚Äôll tailor the learning plan accordingly.
