A robust **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system‚Äîespecially in production or developer-facing use cases‚Äîshould have the following **key features**, grouped by category:

---

### üîç 1. **Document Ingestion & Preprocessing**

* **Multi-format support**: Ingest from PDFs, Word, HTML, CSV, Markdown, databases, websites, etc.
* **Metadata extraction**: Capture and store metadata like author, title, created date, source, etc.
* **Chunking strategy**: Use smart chunking (e.g., recursive text splitting) to preserve context.
* **Preprocessing pipelines**: Clean text, remove boilerplate, normalize encoding, OCR if needed.

---

### üß† 2. **Embedding & Vectorization**

* **Flexible model selection**:

  * Open-source (e.g., BGE, Instructor, E5)
  * Closed (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Azure, Google)
* **Dimensional consistency**: Ensure embedding dimensions match vector DB configuration.
* **Batch embedding**: Efficient embedding of large docs in batches.
* **Support for hybrid search**: Store both vector and sparse (BM25/TF-IDF) representations.

---

### üì¶ 3. **Vector Store / Retriever**

* **Fast retrieval**: Use indexes (HNSW, IVFFlat, etc.) for high-speed ANN search.
* **Filtering support**: Query by metadata (e.g., "filter by document type = invoice").
* **Scalable backend**: Support large volumes (pgvector, FAISS, Qdrant, Weaviate, etc.).
* **Re-ranking**: Optional use of cross-encoders or LLMs to re-rank retrieved results.

---

### ü§ñ 4. **LLM Integration (Generation Layer)**

* **Prompt engineering**: Use structured prompts (e.g., system + user + context blocks).
* **Context window management**: Trim or summarize if retrieved context exceeds token limit.
* **Response formatting**: Return answers in Markdown, JSON, or any app-specific format.
* **Model flexibility**: Support for OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, Mistral, etc.

---

### üß† 5. **Advanced RAG Features**

* **Multi-hop RAG**: Chain multiple retrievals or reasoning steps.
* **Tool use integration**: Call external tools/APIs during reasoning (via agents).
* **Citation tracking**: Return sources used in the answer.
* **Memory / history**: Cache user queries and previous results for follow-up support.

---

### üß™ 6. **Evaluation & Monitoring**

* **Eval framework**: LLM-based scoring, manual labeling, metrics (Precision\@k, F1, etc.).
* **Latency & cost tracking**: Log and monitor API usage, latency, and cost per query.
* **Hallucination detection**: Add guardrails to prevent or flag uncertain generations.

---

### üîê 7. **Security & Access Control**

* **Auth/authz**: User-based access control for private data/documents.
* **Data governance**: Logging, audit trail, and PII redaction options.
* **Rate limiting**: Prevent misuse and overuse of API/model resources.

---

### üß© 8. **Developer & UI Features**

* **REST / GraphQL API**: Serve retrieval + generation over a web API.
* **Streaming support**: Return streamed responses from LLM for faster UX.
* **Feedback collection**: Users can rate answers or report issues.
* **UI integration**: Clean UI for testing queries, uploading docs, and viewing results.

If you're building a **GitHub-level template** for LangChain.js + pgvector + Ollama, I can help you define an architecture checklist or even scaffold the structure based on the above. Let me know!
